# Mona for SaaS

In the world of SaaS, everything happens in real timeâ€”new customers sign up, existing ones renew, some upgrade, and a few may cancel. Each move is a pulse, an event that keeps your business alive. Mona is built to capture that rhythm, connecting these Marketplace events to an Azure Event Grid topic deployed in your cloud environment, making it easier than ever to automate the right workflows at the right time, so you can scale effortlessly and focus on delivering value to your customers.
