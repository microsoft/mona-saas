# Mona for SaaS

In the dynamic world of SaaS, every action—whether it's a new customer signing up, an existing one renewing, upgrading, or even canceling—creates a pulse that keeps your business moving. Mona is designed to capture this rhythm seamlessly. By connecting these Marketplace events to an Azure Event Grid topic within your cloud environment, Mona simplifies the automation of essential workflows. This allows you to scale effortlessly and concentrate on delivering exceptional value to your customers.
